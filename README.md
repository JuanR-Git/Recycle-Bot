### About This Repository

This repository contains my project for **McMaster University Engineering 1P13 Project 3**. In this project, I developed a Python script and integrated it with a Raspberry Pi 4 to automate recycling processes using the Quanser Interactive Labs Virtual Environment. This project was my first real introduction to robotics and had a big impact on my decision to go into Mechatronics.

### Repository Structure üìÅ

  Essential libraries and assets for Q-Labs simulation, including hardware interfaces and utility scripts.

  Your main workspace! Contains the executable code (`main.py`) and simulation assets for running the full recycling system.

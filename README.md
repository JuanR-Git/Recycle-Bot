## Welcome to the Future of Sustainable Engineering! 🌱

### About This Repository

This repository contains the codebase for **McMaster University Engineering 1P13 Project 3: Revenge of the Recycling System**. Designed for first-year engineering students, this project challenges you to integrate hardware and software to automate recycling processes using the Quanser Interactive Labs Virtual Environment.

### What is 1P13 Project 3? 🤔

**1P13** is McMaster’s innovative first-year engineering course, blending multiple disciplines to foster teamwork, creativity, and technical skills.  
**Project 3: Revenge of the Recycling System** tasks students with designing, programming, and operating a virtual recycling system. You’ll control the Q-Arm and Q-Bot to sort, transport, and process recyclable materials—preparing you for real-world engineering challenges and sustainability initiatives.

### Repository Structure 📁

- **Common/**  
  Essential libraries and assets for Q-Labs simulation, including hardware interfaces and utility scripts.

- **Student_Files/**  
  Your main workspace! Contains the executable code (`P3_Code.py`) and simulation assets for running the full recycling system.

### Getting Started 🛠️

1. **Hardware Requirements:**  
   - Raspberry Pi 4 (meeting McMaster’s minimum specs)
   - Quanser Interactive Labs simulation software

2. **Setup Instructions:**  
   - Download both `Common` and `Student_Files` folders to your Pi.
   - Ensure the simulation program is installed and configured.
   - Update the IP address in the code to match your simulation host.

3. **Run the System:**  
   - Execute `P3_Code.py` from the `Student_Files` directory to launch your recycling automation!

### Why This Matters 💡

By completing this project, you’ll:
- Develop hands-on skills in robotics, automation, and Python programming
- Collaborate in multidisciplinary teams
- Contribute to sustainability and environmental stewardship

### About This Repository

This repository contains my project for **McMaster University Engineering 1P13 Project 3**.In this project I developed a python script and integrated with a RaspberryPi 4 to automate recycling processes using the Quanser Interactive Labs Virtual Environment. This project was my first real introduction to robotics and had a big impact on my desicion to go into Mechatronics.
